      "The story revolves around Dom Cobb (played by DiCaprio), who is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased in exchange for performing the act of \"inception\" - planting an idea in someone's mind rather than stealing it. As Cobb and his team navigate through various dream levels, they encounter challenges and face the consequences of manipulating the subconscious.\n",
